# Self Hosting
What you need to know about self hosting. Written by RiversideRocks.

## Introduction
I've been selfhosting for about two weeks now and wanted to share a few tips and things you need to know before you dive in.

## Prerequisites

Before you self host, I cannot stress enough that you need to have a little bit of experience with the Linux operating system (preferably Ubuntu or Debian if you plan on getting a Raspberry Pi). You will have a very bad time if you do not. You also will need access to your wifi router if you plan on hosting a website (this is for port forwarding, which means setting up your wifi router so that it will allow connections of port 80).

## Check the Rules
If you are planning on self hosting, you need to make sure that it is ok with your ISP. While ISPs often are not big fans for people running websites on residencial wifi, it is often allowed as long as it is for non-comerical purposes. If you break the guidelines of your ISP, **there will be consequences**, so be sure to read up on their policies and terms of serice. If your website will be getting a good deal of traffic, I could slow down the wifi if you share it with your familiy or others. Always ask them before your get started.


## Hardware
If you are just getting started, you should 100% buy a Raspberry Pi. End of story. There are alterniataves, but the Raspberry Pi is more popular.

## Cloudflare

If you plan on self hosting, Cloudflare is a must. It hides your IP and prevents DDoS attacks on your machine.

# Pros
- You have 100% Control
- You can shut off the machine at any time for any duration
- 100% Uptime `*`

`*` as long as your power and wifi are on 24/7

# Cons

- If you get DDoSed, you are in big trouble, unless you use a service like Cloudflare.
- Limited space
- Machine may need to be replaced after a few years or so


## Getting Help

If you every need help with self hosting, you can find some great tutorials on YouTube (just look up what you want to do). If you ever run into a bug, you can look it up on StackOverflow. There is a really good chance somebody asked your question eight years ago. *But,* there always is the chance that you cannot find any answers online. Another option is to ask on a coding forum. Here are a few:

# Conclusion

Self Hosting has its pros and cons, but it can be a lot of fun. I wish you the best of luck if you plan to self host!
